# Lending club case study
> Lending club is a finance company which offers loans to applicants. In order to make profitable business, they need to reduce the number of default or charged-off loans. Charged-off loans are those loans where the applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period of time, i.e. he/she has defaulted on the loan
